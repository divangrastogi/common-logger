# Contributing

Thank you for considering a contribution to **Common Logger Utility**. The guidelines below ensure a smooth review process.

## Reporting Issues

- Provide WordPress and PHP versions.
- Include reproduction steps and expected vs. actual results.
- Attach relevant log excerpts generated by `common_logger()`.

## Development Workflow

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Follow the existing coding standards (WordPress PHP coding standards).
3. Run WordPress-specific linters and unit tests when applicable.
4. Update documentation if behavior or settings change.
5. Submit a pull request referencing the issue being addressed.

## Code Style

- Use strict comparisons where possible.
- Sanitize, escape, and validate all input/output.
- Provide meaningful context arrays in every log call when adding new logging.

## Commit Messages

- Use imperative mood (e.g., `Add slow query threshold filter`).
- Reference ticket IDs if your project management requires it.

## Testing

- Verify both storage modes (file and database).
- Test hook tracing, PHP error capture, and slow query detection individually.
- Confirm admin pages render without notices in debug mode.
